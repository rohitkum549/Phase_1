Thread-Safe:
------------
When a thread is already acting on an object, preventing any other thread from acting on the same object is called "Thread-safe" or "Thread Synchronization".


Regular Expressions:
--------------------
Regular Expressions or Regex(in short) in Java is an API for defining String patterns that can be used for searching, manipulating and editing a string in Java

Email Validation, Mobile Number and Passwords are few areas of strings where Regex is widely used to define the constraints.

Regular Expressions are provided under java.util.regex package.

This consists of 3 classes and 1 interface

The java.util.regex package primarily consists of

1.Pattern class
2.Matcher class
3.PatterSyntaxException class
4.MatchResult interface

1.Pattern class:
----------------
This class is a compilation of regular expressions that can be used to define various types of patterns.

This can be created by invoking the compile() method which accepts a regular expression as the first argument, thus returns a pattern after execution.

2.Matcher class:
----------------
This object is used to perform match operations for an input string in java, thus interpreting the previously explained patterns.

Multi-Threading:
----------------
A thread a light weight process under execution with in the process.
MultiThreading is used to improve the performance of the application.

WAP to find the the thread used by JVM to execute the statements


Q:Which thread always run in a Java program by default?
A:main

Why threads are called light-weight?
Threads are light-weight because they utilize minimum resources of the system. THis means they take less memory and less processor time.
