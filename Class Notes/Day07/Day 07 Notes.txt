Traversing:
-----------
Accessing every element of List/Set is called traversing

Iterator interface:
-------------------
This interface is used to traverse the elements of List/Set

Methods:
--------
boolean hasNext()-It checks whether the next element present in the collection or not
Object next()-It gets the next element from the collection

Generics in Collections:
------------------------
Generics are added in Java 5 version.
Generics are used to manage different data types.
When Generics are used in collections we can ensure that the collections contains only similar type of elements.
When Generics are used in collections we can traverse the elements using Enhanced for loop(foreach loop).

Array-->Fixed and simliar data
Collection-->not fixed and different data
Generics-->not fixed and similar data

Set interface:
--------------
Set is an unordered collection of elements
Set does not allow duplicate elements

Classes under Set interface:
----------------------------
HashSet=>Unordered and no duplicate elements
LinkedHashSet=>Ordered and no duplicate items
TreeSet=>sorted and no duplicate items

WAP to remove duplicate mobile numbers from the given list of mobile numbers

Map:
----
Map is used to collect the elements in the form of key-value pairs
Map doesn't allow duplicate keys

Classes under Map Interface:
----------------------------
HashMap=>unordered based on keys and no duplicates
LinkedHashMap=>ordered based on keys and no duplicates
TreeMap=>sorted based on keys and no duplicates

Iterating Maps:
---------------
Get the keys of Map into a Set
