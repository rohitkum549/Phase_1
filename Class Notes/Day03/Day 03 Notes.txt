for loop:
---------
The java for loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times. If the number of iterations is fixed then it is recommended to use.

Nested for:
-----------
If we have a for loop inside another loop, it is known as nested for loop. The inner loop executed completely whenever outer loop executes.

while loop:
-----------
The java while loop is used to iterate a part of the program repeatedly until the specified boolean condition is true

As soon as the Boolean condition becomes false, the loop automatically stops.

If the number of iteration is not fixed, it is recommended to use.

do-while loop:
--------------
The java do-while loop is used iterate a part of the program repeatedly, until the specified condition is true.

If the number of iterations is not fixed and you must have to execute the loop atleast once, it is recommended to use a do-while loop.

do-while loop is called an exit control loop.

while and for loop will check the condition at the begining but do-while will check at the end.

break
------
When a break statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop is immediately terminated.

continue:
---------
when a continue statement is encountered inside a loop, it skips the current iteration and goes for the next iteration.

Arrays:
-------
int a1,a2,a3....a10

int[] a=new int[10];

Array is a collection of similar data type elements.

Types of Arrays:
----------------
1)Single Dimensional Arrays
2)Multi-Dimensional Arrays

1)Single Dimensional Arrays:
----------------------------
int[] marks;//declaration of array
marks=new int[5];//allot memory for storing 5 elements

traversing is a technique to pass through each and every element in the array and printing that element.

2)Multi-Dimensional Arrays:
---------------------------
int marks[][];//declare marks array
marks=new int[3][5];//allot memory for storing 15 elements

3-->rows
5-->columns

WAP to accept rows and columns of a multi-dimensional array from the keyboard and initialize an array. Then accept the aaray elements from the user then, display them in a matrix form.
